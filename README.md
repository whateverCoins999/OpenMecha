# What It Does

This app allows you to select a folder and import a collection of keyboard sounds in **MP3** or **WAV** format. The sounds appear in a list where you can **preview** a sound or **select** it. The selected sound will play every time a key is pressed with **no delay**. You can also adjust the sound volume using the **volume slider**.
